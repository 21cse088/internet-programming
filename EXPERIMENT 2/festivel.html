<p>Lantern Festival or the spring lantern festival is one of the most popular festivals in Singapore. It marks the last day of celebration of the Chinese New Year (15th day). During this day, the kids carry paper lanterns outside, lit them up and release it in the sky. Some paper lanterns are simple and traditional whereas some are of different shapes and sizes. Some even have quizzes on them for the kids to solve. It's a magnificent sight to see several lanterns light up the night sky.</P>
